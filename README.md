## Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
User Story 1
- A Cleveland native has been stuck in the grey, snowy weather and wants to get away to enoy some quick sunshine. His or her vacation time is coming up, and they can head out. The user then enters "sunny" as the weather they are searching for in our app, and we then provide them with 5 cities across the world with forecasts for sunny throughout the next 72-96 hours. From there, the user can pick a city and will be given flight information to that city from Cleveland. (We will determine their exact location using their IP address using the IPStack API (with user permission of course! Otherwise, they can enter their origin manually).

**User Story 2**
- An avid skier is stuck in his place of residence in a hot and humid city.  He is pining to escape and be able to put on his skiis and feel the rush as the frigid air hits his face while flying down the snowy slope of some mountain.  He immediately goes on our webpage, where he is able to book a flight to a city close to various skiing resorts, where he can experience the joy of his favorite pastime.  
 **User Story 3**
- A bank robber is running from the police.  He can feel the "heat" and is not happy with the current "climate" of his immediate environment.  He needs to get away and "cool" down for a few days or twenty years.  So, he gets onto our webpage and quickly finds a flight to a colder place so he can be under the radar.  Of course, there's also the Cayman Islands...
