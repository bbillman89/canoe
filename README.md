User Story 1
- A Cleveland native has been stuck in the grey, snowy weather and wants to get away to enoy some quick sunshine. His or her vacation time is coming up, and they can head out. The user then enters "sunny" as the weather they are searching for in our app, and we then provide them with 5 cities across the world with forecasts for sunny throughout the next 72-96 hours. From there, the user can pick a city and will be given flight information to that city from Cleveland. (We will determine their exact location using their IP address using the IPStack API (with user permission of course! Otherwise, they can enter their origin manually).
